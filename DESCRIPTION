Description: This package implements CBEA, a method to perform set-based analysis for
    microbiome relative abundance data. This approach constructs a competitive balance between
    taxa within the set and remainder taxa per sample. More details can be found in the
    Nguyen et al. 2021+ manuscript. Additionally, this package adds support functions to help
    users perform taxa-set enrichment analyses using existing gene set analysis methods. 
    In the future we hope to also provide curated knowledge driven taxa sets.
