Description: Taxa enrichment analysis is a set of methods used to increase interpretability and incorporate
    prior knowledge in microbiome analyses. This package mainly supports cILR, a new method to perform
    analysis at the sample level by Nguyen et al. 2021+. Additionally, this package adds support for 
    specialized knowledge driven taxa sets, as well as a limited number of similar methods in the gene 
    set literature.
